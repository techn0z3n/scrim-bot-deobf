# scrim-bot-deobf
source code for a heavily vibe coded scrim bot for your shell shockers discord server (no guarantees it functions correctly.) &lt;3
- ⚠ this is in **p*thon**, you may port it to js if you like

# setup & requirements
## requirements:
- your brain
- some kind of terminal/server
- python 3 installed
- your discord bot's token
- some kind of coding knowledge

## setup
1. make sure your bot is in a discord server (with sufficient permissions)
2. install the required files from `requirements.txt`
3. make sure the **required** json files contents are empty "{}", otherwise the bot will not work
4. putting your bots token in the .env file, the one in the example will **not** work.
5. run the main.py & you should be good to go!
6. experiment & modify to your liking.
